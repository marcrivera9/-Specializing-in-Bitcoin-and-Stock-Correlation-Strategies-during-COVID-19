The following data analysis was performed by Marc Rivera(https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcrivera9/) for Analysis Amid Covid 19  Project, and was finalized on 11/04/2023.
# Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze the relationship between Bitcoin prices and selected stocks (COIN, CRWD, PFE) during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on identifying and understanding any negative correlations. By conducting this analysis, we aim to provide insights into how these assets interact in the context of a global health crisis, which can be valuable for investors and decision-makers. This also allows other analysts to take action for further investigation.
